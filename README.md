# Hello! My name is Ye, a fourth-year Computer Science major at UCI. 

I spent my first year learning Python and my second year learning C++, data structures, and algorithms. In my third year, I took on a Statistics minor and finished taking classes for a specialization in Intelligent Systems (AI). This year I will complete my degree by taking upper-division CS courses that I find interesting, such as the AI in Biology and Medicine course I plan to take in the fall. I am also currently looking for internship opportunities for this school year and for entry-level roles after graduation.
