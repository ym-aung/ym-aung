# Hello! My name is Ye, a second-year Computer Science major at UCI. 

But I usually go by Simon.
I spent all of my first year learning Python, and I am currently learning C++.  
My Github is pretty *bare* for now, but *bear* with me as I continue to learn new things and start to create cool projects of my own. ðŸ˜†


I love meeting new people! If you'd like to reach out, here are my contacts:  
Email:    **ymaung@uci.edu**
